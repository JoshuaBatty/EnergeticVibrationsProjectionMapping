# Energetic Vibrations Projection Mapping
This project was developed for Energetic Vibrations Projection Mapping installation as part of the Beyond Perception exhibition at Scienceworks. It is developed using openFrameworks, GLSL, and a modified version of ofxPiMapper. Multi touch support is also available for Windows touch screens.

Click or touch to select a layer. You can then assign a different pattern to that layer by touching one of the patterns on the right. Doing this also chages the sliders on the left to display the patterns interactable parameters. You can change the look of the pattern here by simply moving the sliders, or assigning an audio channel to drive the parameter.

You can also delete the layer by pressing the Remove button in the top right. The Duplicate button next to it will create an extra copy of that layer.

Finally, to add a new layer, either press on the rectangle or the triangle in the top left corner (depending on what shape you want to add). Once added, use the mouse or the touch screen to position and stretch the corners into place.
